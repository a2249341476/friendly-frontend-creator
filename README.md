## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use GPT Engineer**

Simply visit the GPT Engineer project at [GPT Engineer](https://gptengineer.app/projects/1679d9ee-f969-455f-9264-ba7ebf6a4164/improve) and start prompting.

Changes made via gptengineer.app will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in the GPT Engineer UI.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## How can I deploy this project?

All GPT Engineer projects can be deployed directly via the GPT Engineer app.

Simply visit your project at [GPT Engineer](https://gptengineer.app/projects/1679d9ee-f969-455f-9264-ba7ebf6a4164/improve) and click on Share -> Publish.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.gptengineer.app/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)

## How to edit content after deployment

After deploying your project, you can edit the content using the following methods:

1. **Use GPT Engineer**: Visit your project on GPT Engineer and make changes through the interface. These changes will be automatically committed to your repository.

2. **Edit locally and redeploy**: 
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Make the necessary changes using your preferred code editor.
   - Commit and push the changes to the repository.
   - Redeploy the project using the deployment method you initially used (e.g., GPT Engineer's Share -> Publish feature).

3. **Use GitHub's web interface**: 
   - Navigate to your project's repository on GitHub.
   - Find the file you want to edit and click the pencil icon to edit it directly in the browser.
   - Commit your changes.
   - Redeploy the project or set up automatic deployments with your hosting provider.

4. **Content Management System (CMS)**: If your project uses a headless CMS, you can edit content through the CMS interface without changing the code.

Remember to always test your changes in a development environment before deploying to production.
